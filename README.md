# US_States_Game
I made this guess the 50 states game to practice getting specific datapoints from a .csv file, and then using them in the code.  The user is asked for input to guess as many states as they can. Anytime the user lists a correct state, the state's name is populated onto the map in the correct location (using the .csv file data)
